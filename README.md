## About The Project

Sharkuscator is an obfuscation tool designed to make Java and Kotlin bytecode harder to read and reverse-engineer. This
project was started as a way to dive deep into the Java ASM library and understand the intricacies of bytecode
manipulation. It provides a variety of transformation techniques to protect your code.

## üì¶ Project Setup

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shift-jis/sharkuscator.git
```

### 2. Build the Project

```bash
./gradlew build
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

To run Sharkuscator, you will need to provide an input JAR, an output path, and a configuration file.

```bash
java -jar sharkuscator-version.jar --input <input.jar> --output <output.jar> --config <configuration.json>
```

## üîß Configuration Details

- `slash_class_entries`: When set to `true`, slashes (/) are inserted into obfuscated class names, making them appear as
  if they are in a directory structure.
- `exclusions`: In addition to the global `exclusions` at the root of the configuration, you can also define exclusions
  within each individual transformer. This allows for more granular control over which classes or packages are skipped
  by a specific transformation.
- The exclusion patterns use a glob-like syntax. The `**` wildcard is automatically replaced with `.*` to function as a
  regular expression that matches any character sequence. For example, `com/example/**` will exclude all classes under
  the com.example package and its sub-packages.
